# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: August 25, 2017 


**Today's Progress**: Started ES6 and learned about let, const, arrow function and template literals

**Thoughts:** I have done all the things very well and learn the basic understanding of the code and concepts. I think that ES6 is more important right now then old javascript because lot of things were changed.

**Link to work:** I didn't upload the code!!!!!

### Day 1: February 26, 2017 


 **Today's Progress**: Today I learned about New String Methods, Destructuring and how to use with object and arrays. Other than this I also learned for of loop and using with array.

 **Thoughts**: Today I done all the things which have written above. I know these things before but today I found that my concepts are more clear and the things which are not clear before are cleared today

 **Link(s) to work**: Sorry the code was so basic so I didn't upload it.


### Day 2: August 27, Sunday

 **Today's Progress**: Today I have studied about Spread and Rest operater and Promises in ES6.

**Thoughts** : The topic which I have studied is very good and they are also very imp important for future presprective. So I learned a little and focus on understanding part.

**Link(s) to work** : Sorry I didn't upload my work beacuse the code I do is very less.

### Day 3: August 28, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Today I learned about Symbols and how to improve code quality using ESlint and Airbnb. I also learned about Javascript modules and Webpack 2 Tooling Setup and creating my own Module.

**Thoughts** : The topic I studied is very good as they are closely related to React and if I start React then it will help me in future. Literrally, It was fun playing with the modules making my own and importing and exporting was good.

**Link(s) to work** : Sorry I didn't upload the code because it is very less and not structured.
