# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: August 25, 2017 


**Today's Progress**: Started ES6 and learned about let, const, arrow function and template literals

**Thoughts:** I have done all the things very well and learn the basic understanding of the code and concepts. I think that ES6 is more important right now then old javascript because lot of things were changed.

**Link to work:** I didn't upload the code!!!!!

<!-- **Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.-->

<!-- **Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.-->
