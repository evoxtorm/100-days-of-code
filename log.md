# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: August 25, 2017 


**Today's Progress**: Started ES6 and learned about let, const, arrow function and template literals

**Thoughts:** I have done all the things very well and learn the basic understanding of the code and concepts. I think that ES6 is more important right now then old javascript because lot of things were changed.

**Link to work:** I didn't upload the code!!!!!

### Day 1: February 26, 2017 


 **Today's Progress**: Today I learned about New String Methods, Destructuring and how to use with object and arrays. Other than this I also learned for of loop and using with array.

 **Thoughts**: Today I done all the things which have written above. I know these things before but today I found that my concepts are more clear and the things which are not clear before are cleared today
